      <p>Acrobatics</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Dexterity</p>
      <p>You can keep your balance while traversing narrow or treacherous surfaces. You can also dive, flip, jump, and roll to avoid attacks and overcome obstacles.</p>
      <p>==========Cross Narrow Surfaces/Uneven Ground==========</p>
      <p>First, you can use Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling. A successful check allows you to move at half speed across such surfaces—only one check is needed per round. Use the following table to determine the base DC, which is then modified by the Acrobatics skill modifiers noted below. While you are using Acrobatics in this way, you are considered flat-footed and lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC (if any). If you take damage while using Acrobatics, you must immediately make another Acrobatics check at the same DC to avoid falling or being knocked prone.</p>
      <p>-----Cross Narrow Surface DC Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Balancing Pole: Using a balancing pole while traversing a narrow surface grants a +1 circumstance bonus to the Acrobatics check.</p>
      <p>==========Move Through Threatened Squares==========</p>
      <p>In addition, you can move through a threatened square without provoking an attack of opportunity from an enemy by using Acrobatics. When moving in this way, you move at half speed. You can move at full speed by increasing the DC of the check by 10. You cannot use Acrobatics to move past foes if your speed is reduced due to carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor. If an ability allows you to move at full speed under such conditions, you can use Acrobatics to move past foes. You can use Acrobatics in this way while prone, but doing so requires a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC is increased by 5. If you attempt to move through an enemy’s space and fail the check, you lose the move action and provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
      <p>==========Jumping and Falling==========</p>
      <p>Finally, you can use the Acrobatics skill to make jumps or to soften a fall. The base DC to make a jump is equal to the distance to be crossed (if horizontal) or four times the height to be reached (if vertical). These DCs double if you do not have at least 10 feet of space to get a running start. The only Acrobatics modifiers that apply are those concerning the surface you are jumping from. If you fail this check by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold of the other side after having missed the jump. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to make the jump and fall (or land prone, in the case of a vertical jump).</p>
      <p>-----Jump DC Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Faster Base Movement: Creatures with a base land speed above 30 feet receive a +4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed above 30 feet. Creatures with a base land speed below 30 feet receive a –4 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for every 10 feet of their speed below 30 feet. No jump can allow you to exceed your maximum movement for the round.</p>
      <p>Running Jump: For a running jump, the result of your Acrobatics check indicates the distance traveled in the jump (and if the check fails, the distance at which you actually land and fall prone). Halve this result for a standing long jump to determine where you land. Also, see Pole.</p>
      <p>Pole: If you use a pole as part of a running jump, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your Acrobatics check (but must let go of the pole in the process).</p>
      <p>Falling: When you deliberately fall any distance, even as a result of a missed jump, a DC 15 Acrobatics skill check allows you to ignore the first 10 feet fallen, although you still end up prone if you take damage from a fall. See Falling Damage for more details.)</p>
      <p>-----Special Situation: Diving or Jumping into Water-----</p>
      <p>The rules presented here for diving or jumping into water are from a Pathfinder 3rd Party Publisher and are not part of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules created by Paizo. Consult your GM to see if these rules are allowed or in use in his or her campaign.</p>
      <p>Characters who jump or dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 Acrobatics skill check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. Water 30 feet deep is sufficient for a dive from any height. However, the DC of the check increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive. Table: Diving summarizes these rules.</p>
      <p>If the water is not deep enough for a safe dive, add 5 to the DC and treat your dive or fall as 30 feet higher than its actual height on the Table: Diving.</p>
      <p>Action: None. An Acrobatics check is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Skills: If you have 3 or more ranks in Acrobatics, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2, and a +6 dodge bonus to AC when taking the total defense action instead of the usual +4.</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on all Acrobatics checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +4.</p>

      <p>Appraise</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You can evaluate the monetary value of an object.</p>
      <p>==========Appraise Value of Item==========</p>
      <p>Check: A DC 20 Appraise check determines the value of a common item. If you succeed by 5 or more, you also determine if the item has magic properties, although this success does not grant knowledge of the magic item's abilities. If your fail the check by less than 5, you determine the price of that item to within 20% of its actual value. If you fail this check by 5 or more, the price is wildly inaccurate, subject to GM discretion. Particularly rare or exotic items might increase the DC of this check by 5 or more.</p>
      <p>You can also use this check to determine the most valuable item visible in a treasure hoard. The DC of this check is generally 20 but can increase to as high as 30 for a particularly large hoard.</p>
      <p>Action: Appraising an item takes 1 standard action. Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.</p>
      <p>Retry? Additional attempts to Appraise an item reveal the same result.</p>
      <p>-----Modifers-----</p>
      <p>Race: Dwarves get a +2 bonus to determine on Appraise checks made to determine the price of non-magical goods that contain precious metals or gemstones.</p>

      <p>Bluff</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>Check: Bluff is an opposed skill check against your opponent’s Sense Motive skill.</p>
      <p>==========Convey Secret Message==========</p>
      <p>You can use Bluff to pass hidden messages to another character without others understanding your true meaning. The DC of this check is 15 for simple messages and 20 for complex messages. If you are successful, the target automatically understands you, assuming you are speaking in a language that it understands. If your check fails by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures that hear the message can decipher the message by succeeding at an opposed Sense Motive check against your Bluff result.</p>
      <p>Action: Delivering a secret message generally takes twice as long as the message would otherwise take to relay.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes.</p>
      <p>Secret messages can be relayed again if the first attempt fails.</p>
      <p>==========Deceive or Lie==========</p>
      <p>If you use Bluff to fool someone, with a successful check you convince your opponent that what you are saying is true. Bluff checks are modified depending upon the believability of the lie. The following modifiers are applied to the roll of the creature attempting to tell the lie. Note that some lies are so improbable that it is impossible to convince anyone that they are true (subject to GM discretion).</p>
      <p>Retry? If you fail to deceive someone, any further checks made to deceive them are made at a –10 penalty and may be impossible (GM discretion).</p>
      <p>==========Feign Harmlessness==========</p>
      <p>It’s often useful to attempt to convince your enemies you are no threat to them.</p>
      <p>Check: You attempt to convince your target you are harmless through your actions and posture. If you are at least one size category smaller than your target and have taken no effective offensive actions that your target has seen, you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. Even if you have proven yourself capable of dealing damage, an effort to present your previous success as a one-time fluke takes only a –10 penalty on the check.</p>
      <p>Action: Taking steps to appear harmless requires a full-round action, though a GM may require more involved Bluff attempts to take longer.</p>
      <p>Retry? You can attempt to feign harmlessness to the same target again, but each previous failed check increases the DC to convince your target by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour has passed.</p>
      <p>==========Feint in Combat==========</p>
      <p>You can also use Bluff to feint in combat, causing your opponent to be denied his Dexterity bonus to his AC against your next attack. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s base attack bonus + your opponent’s Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent’s Sense Motive bonus, if higher. For more information on feinting in combat, see Combat.</p>
      <p>Action: Feinting in combat is a standard action.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You can attempt to feint against someone again if you fail.</p>
      <p>==========Perform Inconspicuous Action==========</p>
      <p>You can avoid drawing attention to yourself when performing conspicuous actions such as picking up an object in a museum where handling the exhibits is frowned upon but not a matter of grave concern, or closely studying someone across a room at a party.</p>
      <p>Action: You attempt the Bluff check as part of performing the action you wish to render inconspicuous. Normally, you must take twice as long as normal to perform the action in order to make it inconspicuous. A standard action becomes a full-round action completed just before the start of your next turn and a free, immediate, move, or swift action becomes a standard action.</p>
      <p>Check: Your Bluff check is opposed by observers’ Sense Motive checks. You can’t attempt the check if your very presence is suspicious (which you could prevent by altering your appearance with the Disguise skill).</p>
      <p>==========Suggest Course of Action==========</p>
      <p>You can use Bluff and Diplomacy together to make a request of a creature, without it even realizing you have made the request.</p>
      <p>Check: You can gradually coax a target into thinking a suggestion is entirely its own idea, making the creature more likely to act on the idea than if you had suggested it outright. You discuss topics subtly relevant to the request, asking leading questions and narrowing the scope of the conversation so that the target eventually decides to take a specific action you have led it to.</p>
      <p>First attempt a Bluff check to convince the target that your request was actually its idea. This is always treated as far-fetched circumstances, resulting in a –10 penalty on the check. If successful, you then attempt a Diplomacy check to make the request of the creature, treating its attitude toward you as indifferent for this single request (regardless of its actual attitude).</p>
      <p>Action: Planting the notion and then coaxing a target into suggesting the notion himself each require at least 1 minute of continuous interaction. This can be difficult to arrange with a hostile or unfriendly creature.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Familiar: A spellcaster with a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Deceitful feat, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Bluff, the bonus increases to +4.</p>

      <p>Climb</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Strength</p>
      <p>You are skilled at scaling vertical surfaces, from smooth city walls to rocky cliffs.</p>
      <p>Check: With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, wall, or other steep incline (or even across a ceiling, provided it has handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more. A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.</p>
      <p>==========Accelerated Climbing===========</p>
      <p>You try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a –5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).</p>
      <p>Make Your Own Handholds and Footholds</p>
      <p>You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 5 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.</p>
      <p>==========Catch Yourself When Falling==========</p>
      <p>It’s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 20) to do so. It’s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope’s DC + 10).</p>
      <p>==========Catch a Falling Character While Climbing==========</p>
      <p>If someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forgo any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Climbing is part of movement, so it’s generally part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn’t take an action.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Rope: You can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.</p>
      <p>Climb Speed: A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a –5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Climb, the bonus increases to +4.</p>
      <p>Size: Any creature of Tiny or smaller size should use its Dex modifier instead of its Str modifier for Climb and Swim checks (see FAQ).</p>

      <p>Craft: Alchemy</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>
      <p>-----Create Masterwork Item-----</p>
      <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>
      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Other Special Situations and Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Accelerated Crafting: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
      <p>Tools and Equipment: To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>
      <p>Gnome: A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of her choice.</p>
      <p>Craft (mechanical): Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use Craft (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats. Without the Technologist feat, Craft (mechanical) can still be used to craft less advanced forms of technology such as gears, hinges, and pulleys. NPCs with the means of crafting technological items are extremely rare, and it is not assumed that PCs have access to such resources. GMs are encouraged to discuss such considerations with their players before allowing technological crafting into the game.</p>

      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>
      <p>-----Create Masterwork Item-----</p>
      <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>
      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Other Special Situations and Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Accelerated Crafting: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
      <p>Tools and Equipment: To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>
      <p>Gnome: A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of her choice.</p>
      <p>Craft (mechanical): Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use Craft (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats. Without the Technologist feat, Craft (mechanical) can still be used to craft less advanced forms of technology such as gears, hinges, and pulleys. NPCs with the means of crafting technological items are extremely rare, and it is not assumed that PCs have access to such resources.

      <p>Craft: Baskets</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>

      <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>
      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Other Special Situations and Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Accelerated Crafting: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item. This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
      <p>Tools and Equipment: To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>
      <p>Gnome: A gnome receives a +2 bonus on a Craft or Profession skill of her choice.</p>
      <p>Craft (mechanical): Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use Craft (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats. Without the Technologist feat, Craft (mechanical) can still be used to craft less advanced forms of technology such as gears, hinges, and pulleys. NPCs with the means of crafting technological items are extremely rare, and it is not assumed that PCs have access to such resources.

    <Description>
      <p>Craft: Carpentry</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>

The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>
      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>

      <p>Accelerated Crafting: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item.

You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
      <p>Tools and Equipment: To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>

      <p>Craft (mechanical): Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use Craft (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats.

      <p>Craft: Jewelry</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>

      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>

      <p>Craft: Pottery</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>
      <p>-----Create Masterwork Item-----</p>
      <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>

      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>

      <p>-----Other Special Situations and Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Accelerated Crafting: You may voluntarily add +10 to the indicated DC to craft an item.

You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.</p>
      <p>Tools and Equipment: To make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an alchemist’s lab grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.</p>

      <p>Craft (mechanical): Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use Craft (mechanical) in conjunction with technological item crafting feats.

    <Description>
      <p>Craft: Stonemasonry</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>You are skilled in the creation of a specific group of items, such as armor or weapons. Like Knowledge, Perform, and Profession, Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks. The most common Craft skills are alchemy, armor, baskets, books, bows, calligraphy, carpentry, cloth, clothing, glass, jewelry, leather, locks, paintings, pottery, sculptures, ships, shoes, stonemasonry, traps, and weapons.</p>
      <p>A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a Profession skill.</p>
      <p>-----Practice a Trade-----</p>
      <p>You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)</p>
      <p>-----Make Something-----</p>
      <p>The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check result, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.</p>
      <p>To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.</p>
      <p>1. Find the item’s price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).</p>
      <p>2. Find the item’s DC from Table: Craft Skills.</p>
      <p>3. Pay 1/3 of the item’s price for the raw material cost.</p>
      <p>4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s worth of work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but if you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week (or day, see below). If you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Tools: All crafts require artisan’s tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a –2 penalty. On the other hand, masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>
      <p>Fabricate Spell: In some cases, the fabricate spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. You must still make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Ironwood Spell: A successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the ironwood spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.</p>
      <p>Minor Creation: When casting the spell minor creation, you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.</p>
      <p>Progress by the Day: You can make checks by the day instead of by the week if desired. In this case your progress (check result × DC) should be divided by the number of days in a week.</p>
      <p>-----Create Masterwork Item-----</p>
      <p>You can make a masterwork item: a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, see Equipment for the price of other masterwork tools) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.</p>
      <p>Action: Craft checks are made by the day or week (see above).</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.</p>
      <p>-----Repair Item-----</p>
      <p>You can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.</p>

    <Description>
      <p>Diplomacy</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>You can use this skill to persuade others to agree with your arguments, to resolve differences, and to gather valuable information or rumors from people. This skill is also used to negotiate conflicts by using the proper etiquette and manners suitable to the problem.</p>
      <p>==========Gather Information==========</p>
      <p>You can use Diplomacy to gather information about a specific topic or individual. To do this, you must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places. The DC of this check depends on the obscurity of the information sought, but for most commonly known facts or rumors it is 10. For obscure or secret knowledge, the DC might increase to 20 or higher. The GM might rule that some topics are simply unknown to common folk.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You can retry Diplomacy checks made to gather information.</p>
      <p>==========Influence Attitude==========</p>
      <p>You can change the initial attitudes of nonplayer characters with a successful check. The DC of this check depends on the creature’s starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its Charisma modifier.</p>
      <p>Succeed– If you succeed, the character’s attitude toward you is improved by one step. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character’s attitude toward you increases by one additional step. A creature’s attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations.</p>
      <p>Fail– If you fail the check by 4 or less, the character’s attitude toward you is unchanged. If you fail by 5 or more, the character’s attitude toward you is decreased by one step.</p>
      <p>You cannot use Diplomacy against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence of 3 or less. Diplomacy is generally ineffective in combat and against creatures that intend to harm you or your allies in the immediate future. Any attitude shift caused through Diplomacy generally lasts for 1d4 hours but can last much longer or shorter depending upon the situation (GM discretion).</p>
      <p>Retry? You cannot use Diplomacy to influence a given creature’s attitude more than once in a 24 hour period. If a request is refused, the result does not change with additional checks, although other requests might be made.</p>
      <p>==========Make Request==========</p>
      <p>If a creature’s attitude toward you is at least indifferent, you can make requests of the creature. This is an additional Diplomacy check, using the creature’s current attitude to determine the base DC, with one of the following modifiers. Once a creature’s attitude has shifted to helpful, the creature gives in to most requests without a check, unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril. Some requests automatically fail if the request goes against the creature’s values or its nature, subject to GM discretion.</p>
      <p>==========Suggest Course of Action==========</p>
      <p>You can use Bluff and Diplomacy together to make a request of a creature, without it even realizing you have made the request.</p>
      <p>Check: You can gradually coax a target into thinking a suggestion is entirely its own idea, making the creature more likely to act on the idea than if you had suggested it outright. You discuss topics subtly relevant to the request, asking leading questions and narrowing the scope of the conversation so that the target eventually decides to take a specific action you have led it to.</p>
      <p>You first attempt a Bluff check to convince the target that your request was actually its idea. This is always treated as far-fetched circumstances, resulting in a –10 penalty on the check. If successful, you then attempt a Diplomacy check to make the request of the creature, treating its attitude toward you as indifferent for this single request (regardless of its actual attitude).</p>
      <p>Action: Planting a notion and then coaxing a target into suggesting the notion himself each require at least 1 minute of continuous interaction. This can be difficult to arrange with a hostile or unfriendly creature.</p>
      <p>-----Action Summary-----</p>
      <p>Gather Information: Using Diplomacy to gather information takes 1d4 hours of work, searching for rumors and informants.</p>
      <p>Influence Attitude: Using Diplomacy to influence a creature’s attitude takes 1 minute of continuous interaction.</p>
      <p>Make Request: Making a request of a creature takes 1 or more rounds of interaction, depending upon the complexity of the request.</p>
      <p>Suggest Course of Action: at least 1 minute of continuous interaction.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Feats If you have the Persuasive feat, you gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Diplomacy, the bonus increases to +4.</p>

      <p>You are skilled at disarming traps and opening locks. In addition, this skill lets you sabotage simple mechanical devices, such as catapults, wagon wheels, and doors.</p>
      <p>==========Disarm Trap or Device==========</p>
      <p>When disarming a trap or other device, the Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don’t necessarily know whether you’ve succeeded.</p>
      <p>The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.</p>
      <p>If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.</p>
      <p>Special: A rogue who beats a trap’s DC by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (along with her companions) without disarming it.</p>
      <p>Retry? You can retry checks made to disable traps if you miss the check by 4 or less, though you must be aware that you fail in order to try again.</p>
      <p>===========Sabotage Mechanical Item==========</p>
      <p>You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use</p>
      <p>===========Open a Lock==========</p>
      <p>The DC to open a lock depends on the lock’s quality: simple (DC 20), average (DC 25), good (DC 30), or superior (DC 40).</p>
      <p>Modifiers: If you do not have a set of thieves’ tools, these DCs increase by 10.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You can retry checks made to open locks.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check depends on the task:</p>
      <p>Simple Device: Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a full-round action.</p>
      <p>Complex/Intricate Device: An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds. Attempting to open a lock is a full-round action.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Feats If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 bonus on Disable Device skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Disable Device, the bonus increases to +4.</p>
      <p>-----Magic Traps-----</p>
      <p>Characters with the trapfinding class feature can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.</p>
      <p>The spells fire trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike stones, however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.</p>

      <p>Disguise</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>-----Check-----</p>
      <p>Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others’ Perception check results. If you don’t draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Perception checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Perception checks.</p>
      <p>You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Perception checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can’t be sure how good the result is.</p>
      <p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you’re attempting to change your appearance.</p>
      <p>If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Perception checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for.</p>
      <p>Usually, an individual makes a Perception check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and every hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Perception modifier for the group.</p>
      <p>-----Action/Time-----</p>
      <p>Creating a disguise requires 1d3 × 10 minutes of work. Using magic (such as the disguise self spell) reduces this action to the time required to cast the spell or trigger the effect.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they’ll be more suspicious.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Magic Alteration: Magic that alters your form, such as alter self, disguise self, polymorph, or shapechange, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). You must succeed on a Disguise check with a +10 bonus to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual using the veil spell. Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.</p>
      <p>Magic Copies: You must make a Disguise check when you cast a simulacrum spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Deceitful feat you get a +2 bonus on all Disguise skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Disguise, the bonus increases to +4.</p>

      <p>==========Grapple==========</p>
      <p>You can make an Escape Artist check in place of a combat maneuver check to escape a grapple or to change from a pinned condition to merely grappled.</p>
      <p>==========Move Through Tight Space==========</p>
      <p>The DC noted is for getting through a space where your head fits but your shoulders don’t. If the space is long you may need to make multiple checks. You can’t get through a space that your head does not fit through.</p>
      <p>Action Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You can make another check after a failed check if you’re squeezing your way through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, you can make additional checks, or even take 20, as long as you’re not being actively opposed.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>

      <p>Fly</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Dexterity</p>
      <p>You are skilled at flying, either through the use of wings or magic, and you can perform daring or complex maneuvers while airborne. Note that this skill does not give you the ability to fly.</p>
      <p>Special Requirement: You cannot take this skill without a natural means of flight or gliding. Creatures can also take ranks in Fly if they possess a reliable means of flying every day (either through a spell or other magical manner, such as a druid’s wild shape ability).</p>
      <p>-----Check-----</p>
      <p>You generally need only make a Fly check when you are attempting a complex maneuver. Without making a check, a flying creature can remain flying at the end of its turn so long as it moves a distance greater than half its speed. It can also turn up to 45 degrees by sacrificing 5 feet of movement, can rise at half speed at an angle of 45 degrees1, and can descend at any angle at normal speed. Note that these restrictions only apply to movement taken during your current turn. At the beginning of the next turn, you can move in a different direction than you did the previous turn without making a check. Taking any action that violates these rules requires a Fly check. The difficulty of these maneuvers varies depending upon the maneuver you are attempting, as noted on the following chart.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. You can attempt a Fly check to perform the same maneuver on subsequent rounds. If you are using wings and you fail a Fly check by 5 or more, you plummet to the ground, taking the appropriate falling damage.</p>
      <p>==========Avoid Falling After Being Attacked==========</p>
      <p>You are not considered flat-footed while flying. If you are flying using wings and you take damage while flying, you must make a DC 10 Fly check to avoid losing 10 feet of altitude. This descent does not provoke an attack of opportunity and does not count against a creature’s movement.</p>
      <p>==========Avoid Falling After Collision==========</p>
      <p>If you are using wings to fly and you collide with an object equal to your size or larger, you must immediately make a DC 25 Fly check to avoid plummeting to the ground, taking the appropriate falling damage.</p>
      <p>==========Negate Falling Damage==========</p>
      <p>If you are falling and have the ability to fly, you can make a DC 10 Fly check to negate the damage. You cannot make this check if you are falling due to a failed Fly check or a collision. See Falling Damage if you fail this check.</p>
      <p>==========High Wind Speeds==========</p>
      <p>Flying in high winds adds penalties on your Fly checks as noted on the Wind Effects table.</p>
      <p>“Checked” means that creatures of that size or smaller must succeed on a DC 20 Fly check to move at all so long as the wind persists.</p>
      <p>“Blown away” means that creatures of that size or smaller must succeed on a DC 25 Fly check or be blown back 2d6×10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage. This check must be made every round the creature remains airborne. A creature that is blown away must still make a DC 20 Fly check to move due to also being checked.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>None. A Fly check doesn’t require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Familiars: A spellcaster with a bat familiar gains a +3 bonus on Fly checks.</p>
      <p>Fly Speed: Creatures with a fly speed treat the Fly skill as a class skill. A creature with a natural fly speed receives a bonus (or penalty) on Fly skill checks depending on its maneuverability. Creatures without a maneuverability rating are assumed to have average maneuverability and take no penalty on Fly checks. Clumsy –8, Poor –4, Average +0, Good +4, Perfect +8.</p>
      <p>
        Size: A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Fly checks depending on its size category: Fine +8, Diminutive +6, Tiny +4, Small +2, Large –2, Huge –4, Gargantuan –6, Colossal –8</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Fly skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in this skill, the bonus from the Acrobatics feat increases to +4.</p>

      <p>Handle Animal</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>Note: This skill is only available to classes that have it as trained skill.</p>
      <p>You are trained at working with animals, and can teach them tricks, get them to follow your simple commands, or even domesticate them.</p>
      <p>==========Handle an Animal==========</p>
      <p>DC 10</p>
      <p>This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
      <p>==========Push an Animal=========</p>
      <p>DC 25</p>
      <p>To push an animal means to get it to perform a task or trick that it doesn’t know but is physically capable of performing. This category also covers making an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.</p>
      <p>==========Teach an Animal a Trick==========</p>
      <p>DC is based on the type of trick and its purpose below</p>
      <p>You can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks.</p>
      <p>-----Common Tricks-----</p>
      <p>The following tricks can be taught to animals by training the animal for a week and making a successful Handle Animal skill check against the listed DC.</p>
      <p>Aid (DC 20): The animal can use the aid another action to aid a specific ally in combat by attacking a specific foe the ally is fighting. You point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to aid, and you point to another that you want it to make an attack roll against, and it will comply if able. The normal creature type restrictions governing the attack trick still apply. </p>
      <p>Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids, monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals. Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</p>
      <p>Bombard (DC 20): A flying animal can deliver projectiles on command, attempting to drop a specified item that it can carry (often alchemist’s fire or a similar splash weapon) on a designated point or opponent, using its base attack bonus to determine its attack roll. The animal cannot throw the object, and it must be able to fly directly over the target.</p>
      <p>Break Out (DC 20): On command, the animal attempts to break or gnaw through bars or bindings restricting it, its handler, or a person indicated by the handler. If the animal cannot break the restraints by itself, its attempts grant the restricted creature a +4 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. Furthermore, the animal can take certain basic actions such as lifting a latch or bringing its master an unattended key. Weight and Strength restrictions still apply, and pickpocketing a key or picking any sort of lock is still far beyond the animal‘s ability.</p>
      <p>Build Simple Structure (DC 25): The companion can build simple structures on command, limited by its natural abilities and inclinations. The companion is able to build only structures that creatures of its type would naturally build on their own, and this trick merely allows the handler to direct the companion on when and where to build such structures. For example, a spider could be commanded to spin a web between two trees, but it could not be made to create a hammock or a tent out of silk. Similarly, a beaver could be ordered to make a dam or lodge, an alligator a dome-shaped nest, and any burrowing creature a small tunnel or hole. In general, this process takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square the structure occupies, but depending on the terrain and the type of structure, it might take as little as 1 minute or as much as 1 hour or more, at the GM’s discretion. Only companions that naturally build structures can learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Bury (DC 15): an animal with this trick can be instructed to bury an object in its possession. The animal normally seeks a secluded place to bury its object. an animal that knows both the bury and fetch tricks can be instructed to fetch an item it has buried.</p>
      <p>Cocoon (DC 15): The companion can cocoon an object or a helpless or willing Huge or smaller creature in webbing. The amount of time this takes depends on the size of the creature or object to be cocooned, as outlined on the following table. The cocoon has hardness 2 and 10 hit points. A creature trapped within the cocoon is effectively pinned, and it can attempt an Escape Artist check or combat maneuver check as a full-round action to escape (DC = 20 + the companion’s CMD). Alternatively, a DC 25 Strength check can break the cocoon. The companion must know the spin silk trick before it can learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</p>
      <p>Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.</p>
      <p>Deliver (DC 15): The animal takes an object (one you or an ally gives it, or one that it recovers with the fetch trick) to a place or person you indicate. If you indicate a place, the animal drops the item and returns to you. If you indicate a person, the animal stays adjacent to the person until the item is taken. (Retrieving an item from an animal using the deliver trick is a move action.)</p>
      <p>Demolish (DC 15): The companion can be commanded to attack and damage objects and structures. A companion must know the attack trick before it can be taught the demolish trick, and the companion must be trained to attack creatures of all types. The companion’s handler can direct it either to make natural attacks against the object in question or to make a Strength check to attempt to break it (if applicable).</p>
      <p>Detect (DC 25): The animal is trained to seek out the smells of air currents, alchemical items and poisons, unusual noises or echoes, and other common elements that signify the presence of potential dangers or secret passages. When commanded, the animal uses its Perception skill to try to pinpoint the source of anything that strikes it as out of the ordinary about a room or location. Note that because the animal is not intelligent, any number of doors, scents, strange mechanisms, or unfamiliar objects might catch the animal’s attention, and it cannot attempt the same Perception check more than once in this way. </p>
      <p>Down (DC 15) The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</p>
      <p>Entertain (DC 25): The animal can dance, sing, or perform some other impressive and enjoyable trick to entertain those around it. At the command of its owner, the animal can attempt a Perform check (or a Charisma check if it has no ranks in Perform) to show off its talent. Willing onlookers or those who fail an opposed Sense Motive check take a –2 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything but the animal entertaining them. Once an onlooker observes an animal’s entertain trick, that creature cannot be distracted in this way by the same animal for 24 hours. Tricksters and con artists often teach their animals to perform this trick while they pickpocket viewers or sneak about unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Exclusive (DC 20): The animal takes directions only from the handler who taught it this trick. If an animal has both the exclusive and serve tricks, it takes directions only from the handler that taught it the exclusive trick and those creatures indicated by the trainer’s serve command. An animal with the exclusive trick does not take trick commands from others even if it is friendly or helpful toward them (such as through the result of a charm animal spell), though this does not prevent it from being controlled by other enchantment spells (such as dominate animal), and the animal still otherwise acts as a friendly or helpful creature when applicable.</p>
      <p>Feint (DC 20): The companion is trained to feint against opponents. A companion must know the attack trick before it can be taught the feint trick, and it performs feints only against targets it would normally attack.</p>
      <p>Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object.</p>
      <p>Flank (DC 20): You can instruct an animal to attack a foe you point to and to always attempt to be adjacent to (and threatening) that foe. If you or an ally is also threatening the foe, the animal attempts to flank the foe, if possible. While animals following the attack trick will flank when convenient, this trick instructs them to flank even if doing so denies it a full attack or puts the animal companion at an inconvenience or at risk, such as from attacks of opportunity, dangerous positioning, or difficult terrain. The animal must know the attack trick before it can learn this trick, and it performs it only against foes it would normally attack.</p>
      <p>Flee (DC 20): The animal attempts to run away or hide as best it can, returning only when its handler commands it to do so. Until such a command is received, the animal does its best to track its handler and any accompanying creatures, remaining hidden but within range of its sight or hearing. This trick is particularly useful for adventurers and thieves in that it allows the animal to evade capture, and then return later to help free its friends. </p>
      <p>Get Help (DC 20): With this trick, a trainer can designate a number of creatures up to the animal’s Intelligence score as “help.” When the command is given, the animal attempts to find one of those creatures and bring it back to the handler, even if that means journeying a long distance to the last place it encountered the target creature.</p>
      <p>Guard (DC 20) The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</p>
      <p>Guide (DC 15): The companion can serve as a guide to a character that is blinded or otherwise unable to see. While serving as a guide, the companion remains adjacent to the guided creature at all times, readying an action each round to move when that creature moves. This allows the guided creature to automatically succeed at Acrobatics checks to move at more than half speed while blinded. Additionally, the companion identifies obstacles in the guided creature’s path and pushes them, pulls them, or otherwise signals to the creature how to avoid them, allowing the guided creature to locate and move around obstacles such as hazards, opponents, and other terrain features as though she were able to see them (though she can’t distinguish between obstacles). Finally, while serving as a guide, the companion indicates to the guided creature the presence and direction of any adjacent allies, allowing the guided creature to pinpoint the locations of such creatures. The companion can serve as a guide only as long as it is able to see in some fashion, and its ability to detect and avoid creatures and obstacles is limited by what it is able to perceive normally.</p>
      <p>Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</p>
      <p>Hunt (DC 20): This trick allows an animal to use its natural stalking or foraging instincts to find food and return it to the animal’s handler. an animal with this trick can attempt Survival checks (or Wisdom checks, if the animal has no ranks in Survival) to provide food for others or lead them to water and shelter (as the “get along in the wild” use of the Survival skill). an animal with this trick can use the aid another action to grant a bonus on its handlers Survival checks for these purposes. </p>
      <p>Intimidate (DC 15): The companion bares its teeth, barks, bristles, growls, or otherwise threatens a creature you designate, or, alternatively, it can be trained to do so when it encounters any creature besides its handler. The companion takes a –4 penalty on Intimidate checks against creatures other than those with the animal or humanoid types unless it has also been trained to attack creatures of any type. A companion that knows this trick automatically uses the aid another action to assist Intimidate checks attempted by its handler, provided that it is within 15 feet of its handler at the time and has not been ordered to perform another task.</p>
      <p>Maneuver (DC 20): The animal is trained to use a specific combat maneuver on command, even when it naturally wouldn’t do so (animals typically use combat maneuvers only when using a monster ability to make a free combat maneuver, since otherwise it would provoke an attack of opportunity). an animal must know the attack trick before it can be taught the maneuver trick, and it performs maneuvers only against targets it would normally attack. This trick can be taught to an animal multiple times. Each time it is taught, the animal can be commanded to use a different combat maneuver.</p>
      <p>Mark Territory (DC 25): Whether by spraying musk, rubbing its back against trees and rocks, or simply howling loudly, the companion lets other nearby animals know that it has claimed an area. By spending 1 hour performing this trick, the companion can mark an area of up to half a square mile in this fashion. If it does so, after 24 hours, whenever there would be a random encounter within that area that involves a wild animal or other creature of Intelligence 2 or less (including vermin but not other mindless creatures, such as oozes and mindless undead), there is a 25% chance that the encounter doesn’t actually occur, as creatures might be warded off by the markings. The companion must renew any territorial markings at least once per week, or they lose their effectiveness. There is also a 10% chance per week that the markings attract the attention of a powerful predator, which actively seeks out the companion to challenge it (and its master) for the territory. </p>
      <p>Menace (DC 20): A menacing animal attempts to keep a creature you indicate from moving. It does its best to dissuade the target, but it attacks only if the target attempts to move from its present location or take any significant action (particularly a hostile-seeming action). As soon as the target stops moving, the animal ceases attacking but it continues to menace.</p>
      <p>Milk Venom (DC 20): The companion can be coaxed into providing a single dose of venom on command. This process takes 10 minutes, and it requires a vial or similar container in which to store the poison. A companion that has been specifically trained to be milked of its venom never bites, stings, or otherwise poisons its handler when being milked, although the handler must still succeed at a Handle Animal check to successfully harvest the venom (see Harvesting Poisons). A companion must have the poison ability to be taught this trick. </p>
      <p>Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</p>
      <p>Pose as Scenery (DC 20): The companion freezes in place, seeming to be a mundane plant rather than a plant creature. The companion must have taken root in order to use this trick. It attempts a Disguise check with a +8 circumstance bonus, opposed by the Perception checks of observers. If it succeeds at the opposed check, the observer mistakes it for an ordinary, harmless plant. The companion must have the take root trick in order to learn this trick. Only plant companions can learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Receive Spell (DC 25): The companion has been trained to be the recipient of a specific spell (chosen at the time the animal is taught the trick), allowing it to fully take advantage of the spell’s effects. The spell should be one that grants the companion an ability it might not normally be intelligent enough to make use of or one that it might not even realize it has (such as air walk ). The companion is able to recognize when it has been affected by this spell and can take full advantage of the spell’s effects. At the GM’s discretion, a companion can also be trained to receive certain nonspell effects, such as those granted by an elixir of fire breathing. The companion can be taught this trick multiple times; each time it learns this trick, it becomes trained to utilize a different spell effect.</p>
      <p>Rescue (DC 20): The companion has been trained to drag its handler or another creature that the handler designates out of danger and to a safe place in the event that the handler or creature is incapacitated. If a creature that the companion is defending is rendered helpless or is slain, the companion will carry, drag, or otherwise move that creature out of danger. If the companion knows the get help trick, it will attempt to bring the creature it is rescuing to one of the creatures designated as “help.” Otherwise, you can designate a single location in advance as a safe place, and the companion will attempt to bring the creature it is rescuing to that place. If it is unable to do either of these, the companion simply moves the creature to the nearest location of relative safety. A companion must have the deliver and guard tricks in order to learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</p>
      <p>Serve (DC 15): An animal with this trick willingly takes orders from a creature you designate. If the creature you tell the animal to serve knows what tricks the animal has, it can instruct the animal to perform these tricks using your Handle Animal bonus on the check instead of its own. The animal treats the designated ally as friendly. An animal can unlearn this trick with 1 week of training. This trick can be taught to an animal multiple times. Each time it is taught, the animal can serve an additional creature you designate.</p>
      <p>Sneak (DC 15): The animal can be ordered to make Stealth checks in order to stay hidden and to continue using Stealth even when circumstances or its natural instincts would normally cause it to abandon secrecy.</p>
      <p>Spin Silk (DC 20): The companion can create strands of delicate yet incredibly strong silk. Harvesting the silk takes 10 minutes, and it can be done once per day. This silk functions identically to a silk rope. The companion can produce a total number of feet of silk equal to 10 times its Constitution score per day, which can be divided as the handler chooses in 10-foot increments. Silk produced in this way degrades into uselessness after 24 hours. Only companions with the web ability can learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</p>
      <p>Subdue (DC 15): The companion can attempt to subdue opponents. Once the command is given, the companion makes all its natural attacks as nonlethal attacks (taking the typical –4 penalty on attack rolls when using normally lethal attacks) until ordered to do otherwise.</p>
      <p>Take Root (DC 15): The companion extends its roots into the soil beneath it, anchoring itself in place and drawing water and nutrients from the soil. Taking root is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. While rooted, the companion cannot move, but it can otherwise act normally and gains a +4 bonus to CMD to resist bull rush, drag, overrun, reposition, and trip attempts. If the companion remains rooted for at least 1 hour, it absorbs enough water and nutrients to feed itself for a day. A separate command causes the companion to uproot itself as a full-round action. The companion can take root only in areas of soft soil. Only plant companions can learn this trick. </p>
      <p>Track (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability)</p>
      <p>Throw Rider (DC 15): The animal can attempt to fling a creature riding it to the ground. Treat this as a trip combat maneuver that applies to all creatures riding the animal, and that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An animal that knows the throw rider and exclusive tricks can be instructed to attempt to automatically throw anyone other than its trainer who attempts to ride it.</p>
      <p>Watch (DC 15): The animal can be commanded to keep watch over a particular area, such as a campsite, and to raise an alarm if it notices any dangerous or sizable creature entering the area. </p>
      <p>Withhold Venom (DC 20): The companion can be ordered to avoid injecting poison into creatures it strikes with whatever natural attack would normally deliver venom. As long as the companion has been ordered to withhold its venom, successful hits with that natural attack deal damage as normal and convey all other effects that they normally would, but they do not expose the target to the companion’s poison. Only companions with the poison special ability can learn this trick.</p>
      <p>Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</p>
      <p>==========Train an Animal for a Purpose==========</p>
      <p>Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>
      <p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.</p>
      <p>-----Tricks of Purpose-----</p>
      <p>Air Support (DC 20): An animal trained in air support knows the attack, bombard, and deliver tricks.</p>
      <p>Burglar (DC 25): An animal trained as a burglar knows the come, fetch, maneuver (steal), seek, and sneak tricks. You can order it to steal a specific item you point out.</p>
      <p>Combat Training (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes 6 weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat by spending 3 weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Many horses and riding dogs are trained in this way.</p>
      <p>Fighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.</p>
      <p>Guarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.</p>
      <p>Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.</p>
      <p>Hunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.</p>
      <p>Liberator (DC 25): An animal trained in liberating knows the break out, flee, and get help tricks.</p>
      <p>Performance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.</p>
      <p>Riding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.</p>
      <p>Servant (DC 20): An animal trained as a servant knows the deliver, exclusive, and serve tricks.</p>
      <p>==========Rear a Wild Animal==========</p>
      <p>To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once. A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it’s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Varies. Handling an animal is a move action, while “pushing” an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle her animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Low Intelligence Non-Animals: You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.</p>
      <p>Animal Companions: A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion. In addition, a druid’s or ranger’s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don’t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>
      <p>-----Special-----</p>
      <p>Untrained: If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can’t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can’t teach, rear, or train other non-domestic animals.</p>

      <p>Heal</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Wisdom</p>
      <p>You are skilled at tending to the ailments of others.</p>
      <p>Check: The DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p>
      <p>==========Identify Drugs/Pharmaceuticals==========</p>
      <p>The Heal skill is used to identify and understand pharmaceuticals. </p>
      <p>==========Provide First Aid==========</p>
      <p>You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause bleed.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 1 standard action.</p>
      <p>Retry? You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>
      <p>==========Provide Long-Term Care==========</p>
      <p>Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>
      <p>You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 8 hours.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure.</p>
      <p>==========Treat Deadly Wounds==========</p>
      <p>Requirement: You must expend two uses from a healer’s kit to perform this task. You take a –2 penalty on your check for each use from a healer’s kit that you lack.</p>
      <p>When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 1 hour.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure.</p>
      <p>==========Treat Disease==========</p>
      <p>To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the disease.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure.</p>
      <p>==========Treat Poison==========</p>
      <p>To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence bonus on his saving throw against the poison.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 1 standard action.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure.</p>
      <p>==========Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones==========</p>
      <p>A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>
      <p>A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.</p>
      <p>Action/Time: 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Retry? Varies. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Self-Sufficient feat, you get a +2 bonus on all Heal checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Heal, the bonus increases to +4.</p>
      <p>Equipment: A healer’s kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.</p>

    <Description>
      <p>Intimidate</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>You can use this skill to frighten your opponents or to get them to act in a way that benefits you. This skill includes verbal threats and displays of prowess.</p>
      <p>==========Coerce Opponent==========</p>
      <p>Sometimes you need to cow someone into submission for more than just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Action: Coercing a target into acting friendly for hours takes 1d4 × 10 minutes. Coercing a target into acting friendly for days requires you to successfully use coercion at least once per week for 1d6 weeks without failing any Intimidate checks against the target during that time.</p>
      <p>Try Again: You can’t attempt long-term coercion against the same target again for 1 week.</p>
      <p>Check: By spending more time threatening or harassing a target, you can attempt to force a creature to act friendly toward you for 1d6 hours + 1 hour for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC. If you succeed at such a check against the same target at least once per week for 1d6 weeks (without ever failing any Intimidate checks against the target during that time), the duration of the coercion increases to 2d8 days. Coercion is overt, not subtle, and in most cases using coercion against a creature is an evil act.</p>
      <p>A coerced target acts as though friendly toward you even when you aren’t around, but the aid offered remains grudging at best. The target’s true attitude is hostile, and if the target believes it can take an action to hinder you that can’t be traced back to it, it’s likely to take such opportunities.</p>
      <p>Creatures attempting to enlist its aid against you can often do so by convincing the target they are able to protect it from your wrath, using the normal Diplomacy rules.</p>
      <p>==========Demoralize Opponent==========</p>
      <p>You can use this skill to cause an opponent to become shaken for a number of rounds. This shaken condition doesn’t stack with other shaken conditions to make an affected creature frightened. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Wisdom modifier.</p>
      <p>Success: If you are successful, the target is shaken for one round. This duration increases by 1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC. You can only threaten an opponent this way if it is within 30 feet and can clearly see and hear you. Using demoralize on the same creature only extends the duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition.  </p>
      <p>Fail: The opponent is not shaken.</p>
      <p>Action: Demoralizing an opponent is a standard action.</p>
      <p>Retry? You can attempt to intimidate an opponent again, but each additional check increases the DC by +5. This increase resets after one hour has passed.</p>
      <p>==========Influence Opponent’s Attitude==========</p>
      <p>You can use Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward you for 1d6 × 10 minutes with a successful check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target’s Hit Dice + the target’s Wisdom modifier.</p>
      <p>Success: If successful, the opponent will: give you information you desire, take actions that do not endanger it, offer other limited assistance. After the intimidate expires, the target treats you as unfriendly and may report you to local authorities.</p>
      <p>Fail: If you fail this check by 5 or more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities.</p>
      <p>Action: Using Intimidate to change an opponent’s attitude requires 1 minute of conversation.</p>
      <p>Retry? You can attempt to intimidate an opponent again, but each additional check increases the DC by +5. This increase resets after one hour has passed.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Size: You gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks if you are larger than your target, and a –4 penalty on Intimidate checks if you are smaller than your target.</p>
      <p>Feats: If you have the Persuasive feat, you gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, the bonus increases to +4.</p>
      <p>Race: A half-orc gets a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</p>

      <p>You are educated in a field of study and can answer both simple and complex questions. Like the Craft, Perform, and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of different specialties.</p>
      <p>Many of the Knowledge skills have specific uses as noted on Table: Knowledge Skill DC’s.</p>
      <p>-----Fields of Study-----</p>
      <p>Arcana: (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, constructs, dragons, magical beasts); Although robots are constructs, Knowledge (arcana) cannot be used to identify robots or their abilities and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Dungeoneering: (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</p>
      <p>Engineering: (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications); This is the most important skill with regard to technological subjects. Knowledge (engineering) can be used to identify a robot’s abilities and weaknesses. Knowledge (engineering) is also used to identify and understand unknown technological objects in a similar manner to how Spellcraft is used to identify the properties of a magic item. The DC to correctly identify and understand an unknown technological object is equal to the object’s Craft DC. An object with a Craft DC of 15 or less can be automatically identified and understood by someone trained in Knowledge (engineering) who also has the Technologist feat.</p>
      <p>Geography: (lands, terrain, climate, people); Used for astronomy.</p>
      <p>History: (wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</p>
      <p>Local: (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</p>
      <p>Nature: (animals, fey, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</p>
      <p>Nobility: (lineages, heraldry, personalities, royalty)</p>
      <p>Planes: (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, planar magic)</p>
      <p>Religion: (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</p>
      <p>==========General Knowledge==========</p>
      <p>Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>
      <p>Action: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).</p>
      <p>Retry? No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>
      <p>==========Monster Lore==========</p>
      <p>You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Check: In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>
      <p>Action: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).</p>
      <p>Retry? No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Training: You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10.</p>
      <p>Equipment (Library): If you have access to an extensive library that covers a specific skill, this limit is removed. The time to make checks using a library, however, increases to 1d4 hours. Particularly complete libraries might even grant a bonus on Knowledge checks in the fields that they cover.</p>
      <p>==========Recall Intrigues (Knowledge)==========</p>
      <p>You can identify feats and the class features of various classes with successful Knowledge checks when you observe the feats or class features being used.</p>
      <p>Check: You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how Spellcraft can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the Knowledge check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of Iron Will, so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using Cleave) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as Arcane Strike, Combat Expertise, or Enlarge Spell), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as Dodge or Lightning Reflexes), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.</p>
      <p>Add 10 to the DC if the class is a prestige class</p>
      <p>The Knowledge skill required to identify a feat or class feature varies depending on the type of feat or class feature to be identified and is outlined in the Recall Intrigues (Knowledge) table above, along with the DCs of such skill checks.</p>

      <p>Action: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).</p>
      <p>Retry? No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>
      <p>==========Monster Lore==========</p>
      <p>You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Check: In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>

      <p>==========Recall Intrigues (Knowledge)==========</p>
      <p>You can identify feats and the class features of various classes with successful Knowledge checks when you observe the feats or class features being used.</p>
      <p>Check: You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how Spellcraft can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the Knowledge check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of Iron Will, so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using Cleave) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as Arcane Strike, Combat Expertise, or Enlarge Spell), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as Dodge or Lightning Reflexes), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.</p>
      <p>Add 10 to the DC if the class is a prestige class</p>
      <p>The Knowledge skill required to identify a feat or class feature varies depending on the type of feat or class feature to be identified and is outlined in the Recall Intrigues (Knowledge) table above, along with the DCs of such skill checks.</p>

      <p>You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Check: In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.</p>
      <p>Action: Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see “Untrained,” below).</p>

      <p>Training: You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10.</p>
      <p>Equipment (Library): If you have access to an extensive library that covers a specific skill, this limit is removed. The time to make checks using a library, however, increases to 1d4 hours. Particularly complete libraries might even grant a bonus on Knowledge checks in the fields that they cover.</p>
      <p>==========Recall Intrigues (Knowledge)==========</p>
      <p>You can identify feats and the class features of various classes with successful Knowledge checks when you observe the feats or class features being used.</p>
      <p>Check: You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how Spellcraft can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the Knowledge check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of Iron Will, so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using Cleave) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as Arcane Strike, Combat Expertise, or Enlarge Spell), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as Dodge or Lightning Reflexes), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.</p>
      <p>Add 10 to the DC if the class is a prestige class</p>
      <p>The Knowledge skill required to identify a feat or class feature varies depending on the type of feat or class feature to be identified and is outlined in the Recall Intrigues (Knowledge) table above, along with the DCs of such skill checks.</p>

      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>Note: This skill is only available to classes that have it as trained skill.</p>
      <p>You are educated in a field of study and can answer both simple and complex questions. Like the Craft, Perform, and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of different specialties.</p>
      <p>Many of the Knowledge skills have specific uses as noted on Table: Knowledge Skill DC’s.</p>
      <p>-----Fields of Study-----</p>
      <p>Arcana: (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, constructs, dragons, magical beasts); Although robots are constructs, Knowledge (arcana) cannot be used to identify robots or their abilities and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Dungeoneering: (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</p>
      <p>Engineering: (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications); This is the most important skill with regard to technological subjects. Knowledge (engineering) can be used to identify a robot’s abilities and weaknesses. Knowledge (engineering) is also used to identify and understand unknown technological objects in a similar manner to how Spellcraft is used to identify the properties of a magic item. The DC to correctly identify and understand an unknown technological object is equal to the object’s Craft DC. An object with a Craft DC of 15 or less can be automatically identified and understood by someone trained in Knowledge (engineering) who also has the Technologist feat.</p>

      <p>Linguistics</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Intelligence</p>
      <p>Note: This skill is only available to classes that have it as trained skill.</p>
      <p>You are skilled at working with language, in both its spoken and written forms. You can speak multiple languages, and can decipher nearly any tongue given enough time. Your skill in writing allows you to create and detect forgeries as well.</p>
      <p>You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion; failure means that you do.)</p>
      <p>Both the Linguistics check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly by the GM, so that you can’t tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.</p>
      <p>==========Learn a Language==========</p>
      <p>Whenever you put a rank into this skill, you learn to speak and read a new language. Common languages (and their typical speakers) are listed below.</p>
      <p>Aboleth: Aboleth and other deep sea (aquatic) aberrations.</p>
      <p>Abyssal: Demons and other chaotic evil outsiders. The language of demons, Abyssal is often spoken by evil spirits.</p>
      <p>Aklo: Derro, inhuman or otherworldly monsters, evil fey. This ancient tongue is spoken by strange eldritch entities, and certain ancient beings.</p>
      <p>Aquan (“Tongue of the Sea”): Aquatic and water-based creatures. The so-called “tongue of the sea” is spoken primarily in the sunken nation of the locathahs— those who trade frequently with the ocean empires often speak this tongue as well.</p>
      <p>Auran (“Tongue of the Heavens”): Flying creatures, air-based creatures. A soft-spoken, breathy language, also known as the “tongue of the heavens.”</p>
      <p>Boggard: Boggard.</p>
      <p>Celestial: Angels and other good outsiders. The language of angels.</p>
      <p>Common: humans and the other core races</p>
      <p>Cyclops: Cyclops and there kin. Once the ancient language of the giants, this tongue was created before the rise of humanity by the cyclopes.</p>
      <p>Dark Folk: Dark creepers, dark slayers, and dark stalkers (creatures of the Dark Folk subtype.)</p>
      <p>Draconic: Dragons, reptilian humanoids.</p>
      <p>Drow Sign Language: Drow. Like Druidic, drow sign language is a “secret” language.</p>
      <p>Druidic: Druids only. Druidic is a secret language known only to druids. It is a free language for a druid; that is, it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids and has its own alphabet.</p>
      <p>Dwarven: Dwarves.</p>
      <p>D’ziriak: The insectoid d’ziriak language consists of buzzes and chitters. It is an obscure one known by few outside their race.</p>
      <p>Elven: Elves, half-elves.</p>
      <p>Giant: Cyclops, ettins, giants, ogres, trolls. This brutish tongue and its numerous minor variants are spoken in any region where the wrath of giants is known.</p>
      <p>Gnoll: Gnolls.</p>
      <p>Gnome: Gnomes.</p>
      <p>Goblin: Bugbears, goblins, hobgoblins. The official language of hobgoblins, this dialect is similar to the goblin tongue.</p>
      <p>Grippli: Grippli.</p>
      <p>Halfling: Halfling.</p>
      <p>Ignan (“Tongue of Fire”): Fire-based creatures.</p>
      <p>Infernal: Devils and other lawful evil outsiders. The language of devils is often spoken by evil spirits.</p>
      <p>Necril: Undead: An ancient language of the dead, this whispering tongue is shared among undead and is also often associated with necromancy.</p>
      <p>Orc: Orc, Half-Orc</p>
      <p>Protean: Proteans. Like the proteans chaotic nature, the protean language itself is mutable, evolving so quickly that few outsiders can understand it without magical aid.</p>
      <p>Sphinx: Sphinxes.</p>
      <p>Sylvan: Centaurs, fey creatures, plant creatures, unicorns. The language of the fey.</p>
      <p>Tengu: Tengu. the official language of the Tengu race.</p>
      <p>Terran (“Tongue of Earth”): Earth-based creatures.</p>
      <p>Treant: Treants.</p>
      <p>Undercommon: Drow, duergar, morlocks, svirfneblin. This language is derived from an ancient combination of Elven and even older tongues.</p>
      <p>Vegepygmy: Vegepygmy. Vegepygmy is not a spoken language since vegepygmies cannot speak. They communicate via a crude language of rhythmic taps, beats, and clicks.</p>
      <p>==========Create or Detect Forgeries==========</p>
      <p>Creating a forgery can take anywhere from 1 minute to 1d4 minutes per page. Detecting a forgery using Linguistics takes 1 round of examination per page.</p>
      <p>Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person’s handwriting is needed.</p>
      <p>The Linguistics check is made secretly, so that you’re not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don’t make a check until someone examines the work. Your Linguistics check is opposed by the Linguistics check of the person who examines the document to verify its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers if any of the conditions are listed on the table above.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Varies. Deciphering a page of ordinary text takes 1 minute (10 consecutive rounds). Creating a forgery can take anywhere from 1 minute to 1d4 minutes per page. Detecting a forgery using Linguistics takes 1 round of examination per page.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Trained: You must be trained to use this skill, but you can always attempt to read archaic and strange forms of your own racial bonus languages. In addition, you can also always attempt to detect a forgery.</p>
      <p>Special: Members of the same organization (such as a city’s thieves’ guild) gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Linguistics checks to pass secret messages to each other, and on Sense Motive checks to intercept messages from their allies.</p>
      <p>Special: A sign language or gestural system can be used as a free action to silently communicate simple concepts to others who know the language or code, so long as those communicating can clearly see each other. More complicated conversations require additional time, just as with verbal speech. Some gestural systems are too simple to communicate more than basic tactical information. Onlookers unfamiliar with the gestures can interpret the secret message with a successful DC 25 Linguistics or Sense Motive check.</p>

      <p>Perception</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Wisdom</p>
      <p>Your senses allow you to notice fine details and alert you to danger. Perception covers all five senses, including sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.</p>
      <p>==========Notice Someone/Something==========</p>
      <p>Perception has a number of uses, the most common of which is an opposed check versus an opponent’s Stealth check to notice the opponent and avoid being surprised. If you are successful, you notice the opponent and can react accordingly. If you fail, your opponent can take a variety of actions, including sneaking past you and attacking you.</p>
      <p>Perception is also used to notice fine details in the environment. The DC to notice such details varies depending upon distance, the environment, and how noticeable the detail is. The following table gives a number of guidelines.</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Most Perception checks are reactive, made in response to observable stimulus. Intentionally searching for stimulus is a move action.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. You can try to sense something you missed the first time, so long as the stimulus is still present.</p>
      <p>-----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Race: Elves, half-elves, gnomes, and halflings receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Creatures with the scent special quality have a +8 bonus on Perception checks made to detect a scent. Creatures with the tremorsense special quality have a +8 bonus on Perception checks against creatures touching the ground and automatically make any such checks within their range.</p>
      <p>Familiars: A spellcaster with a hawk or owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Perception checks. If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Perception (and Sense Motive) checks.</p>

      <p>PPerform</p>
      <p>Goverened By: Charisma</p>
      <p>You are skilled at one form of entertainment, from singing to acting to playing an instrument. Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks.</p>
      <p>Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small sample of which is provided for each category below.</p>
      <p>
        Act (comedy, drama, pantomime)
        Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)
        Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)
        Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)
        Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)
        Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)
        String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)
        Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, trumpet)
        Sing (ballad, chant, melody)</p>
      <p>-----Action-----</p>
      <p>Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public requires anywhere from an evening’s work to a full day’s performance. The bard’s special Perform-based abilities are described in that class’s description.</p>
      <p>Retry? Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don’t negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 for each previous failure.)</p>
      <p>----Modifiers-----</p>
      <p>Equipment: A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on all Perform checks that involve its use.</p>
      <p>Trained: A bard must have ranks in specific Perform categories to use some of his Bardic Performance abilities.</p>
